    <p>This simple webpage gives an in-depth focus about me. 
        It contains my goals, my drive, and my reason for being an AlT SCHOOL student.
        I am using the HTML skills I have learnt so far in ALT SCHOOL to create this webpage.
        Enjoy!

                    <p>My name is Folayinka Oluwatoyosi Olaofe and my ALT School ID is: ALT/SOE/023/2271. I am a Software Developer by profession, with a
                        strong focus in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central development. I am a reserved, calm
                        and collected individual. I enjoy playing games, watching movies and being around close 
                        friends and family. I aspire to be one of the most recognized software developers in Nigeria,
                        and through hardwork, consistency and commitment, I am sure I can attain it.

            <div>
                <p>I chose ALTSCHOOL for different reasons, but the major one was because, their model and style of
                    teaching seemed perfect for me. I am a 9-5 worker so the timing of classes and being able to balance
                    both were very important factors for me; and I found that in ALTSCHOOL.
                    Here are a list of other reasons I chose ALTSCHOOL:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Affordability</li>
                        <li>Flexibility</li>
                        <li>Preferrable Learning Track</li>
                        <li>Worldwide Recoginition</li>
                        <li>Track Record</li>
                        <li>ALTSCHOOL's Goals & Values</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
       </details>
       <br>
           <details>
            <summary id="ALTGOAL">What do I intend to achieve at ALTSCHOOL?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I hope that by the end (or even before) of my time at ALT School I can be a comfortable software and back-end developer. 
                    I am working towards having projects under my name by the time I am completing this programme.
